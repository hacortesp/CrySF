# Examples how to use CrySF 


This folder contains two examples demonstrating how to use CrySF with different materials: the cubic phase of Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (cLLZO) and Li<sub>10</sub>GeP<sub>2</sub>S<sub>12</sub> (LGPS). The cLLZO example is simulated with LAMMPS, while the LGPS example is simulated with VASP. Each example includes a Jupyter notebook and accompanying Python scripts.

```
densitypam.py
crysf.py
```

These scripts can be run from the terminal and serve as templates for analyzing your own simulation trajectories
